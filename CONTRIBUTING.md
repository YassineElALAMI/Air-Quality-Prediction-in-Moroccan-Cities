# Contributing to Air Quality Prediction

We welcome contributions from everyone! Here's how you can help:

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
2. Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
   - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
   - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
3. Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

1. Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
   - This is usually the `develop` branch.
   - To quickly create a topic branch based on develop:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/your-fix-name develop
   ```
   Please avoid working directly on the `develop` branch.

2. Make commits of logical units.

3. Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

4. Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.

5. Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.

2. Submit a pull request to the repository in the `develop` branch.

3. In your pull request, include a description of what your changes do and why they are needed.
